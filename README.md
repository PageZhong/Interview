Welcome to this page,
I'd like to make a short introduction.<br />
I worked in oil & gasoline for the last four years as a safety officer, <br />
including one year, working for a Canadian service company.<br />
Because the job kept me working away from Chengdu City most of the time.<br />
you can say it's in the middle of nowhere.<br />
So I decided to settle down. I was beginning to study web development from scratch. But I love it. <br />
If you can offer me a chance, I won't let you down.<br />
<h4>Coding is My life!</h4>
If you want to know me more. send me E-mail. tedbird@163.com, or wechat Ted_Zhong<br />
Thank You.
